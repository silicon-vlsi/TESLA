# Project Tesla
Project Tesla is a DC-to-DC conversion project designed and developed in 0.18um high voltage CMOS SOI process. This project uses a programmable bandgap reference (BGR) circiit, a R-2R ladder digital-to-analog converter (DAC) circuit, a serial Peripheral interface (SPI) circuit and a ring voltage contorled oscillator (VCO) circuit.
# Bandgap Voltage Reference (BGR)
A bandgap voltage reference is a temperature independent voltage reference circuit widely used in integrated circuits. It produces a fixed (constant) voltage regardless of power supply variations, temperature changes and circuit loading from a device. It commonly has an output voltage around 1.2 V (close to the theoretical 1.205 eV band gap of silicon at 0 K).

## Features
## Applications
## Description
An op-amp based bandgap reference is designed. The small size and low power consumption of the BGR make it ideal for portable and battery-powered applications. The BGR can be operated from a supply as low as 1.5V to the maximum supply voltage of 5V. This BGR provides a temperature coefficient (tempco) of less than 20 ppm/degree-centigrade for wide range of temperature sweep (–40°C to +125°C).
